Project Status
--------------

This was worthwhile and worked when I last used it.
However, I have moved on, no longer use this or know if it is valuable,
and have no capacity to meaningfully maintain it.

**Unmaintained**

Introduction
------------
[SketchUp][1] is a pretty slick application, and [OpenSceneGraph
(OSG)][2] is a great 3D rendering system. SketchUp can export its models
to [COLLADA (`.dae`)][3], and OpenSceneGraph conveniently has a plugin
to load COLLADA models, though it (and/or its dependencies) can be tough
to build. You could create native `.osg`/`.ive` models by exporting to
COLLADA, then using `osgconv` to convert them. Since SketchUp has
support for plugins written in Ruby, why not combine the steps and make
a plugin that bundles a COLLADA-capable OSG build and can set up the
COLLADA export and conversion processes for the best results?

Well, that's what this is - a plugin for combining those steps. It's been
useful to us - hopefully it's useful to you as well!

If you have modifications or improvements, they're gratefully appreciated.
Just use GitHub to fork/edit the scripts, then send a pull request if you'd
like your improvements integrated upstream.

Getting Started
---------------
The preferred way to install extensions into SketchUp is now using an
`.rbz` file. See [these instructions][install-rbz] in the SketchUp
documentation on how to do this.

[install-rbz]:http://help.sketchup.com/en/article/38583

We also (for some versions, at least) have some Windows `.exe`
installers or Mac `.pkg` available. This used to be super cool, but is
harder for us to maintain and isn't nearly as necessary since 8.0 M2
simplified extension installation with `.rbz` support.

[Download the one you want from GitHub.](https://github.com/rpavlik/sketchupToOSG/releases)

No matter how you install, the results are the same. SketchUp should
have an Export to OpenSceneGraph menu under File next time you start it.

Platforms this should work on, and which file you want:
- Windows
  - SketchUp 8
    - Tested free and pro
    - Use a `su2013-win` download in either `.rbz` (starting with M2) or
      `.exe` installer format.
  - SketchUp 2013
    - Tested Make (free)
    - Use a `su2013-win` download in either `.rbz` or `.exe` installer format.
  - SketchUp 2014
    - Tested Make (free) and Pro
    - Use a `su2014-win` in `.rbz` format.
- Mac OS X
  - SketchUp 8
    - Use a `su2013-mac` download in either `.rbz` (starting with M2) or
      `.pkg` installer format.
  - SketchUp 2013
    - Tested Make (free)
    - Use a `su2013-mac` download in either `.rbz` or `.pkg` installer format.
  - SketchUp 2014
    - Tested Make (free)
    - Use a `su2014-mac` in `.rbz` format.

Advanced Use of `.exe` Installers: Unattended Installation (for Administrators)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The `.exe` installer has been built with Inno Setup, so the normal command-line
arguments used by that installer system are available. In particular, if
you want to run an unattended install that shows the progress dialog
while it's working, run a command like:

    setup-sketchupToOpenSceneGraphPlugin-VERSIONGOESHERE.exe /SP- /SILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES

For an unattended install that doesn't show any windows at all, run
something like:

    setup-sketchupToOpenSceneGraphPlugin-VERSIONGOESHERE.exe /SP- /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES

Manual Installation
-------------------
Unzip an appropriate `.rbz` (`.zip` file in disguise) into your SketchUp
Plugins folder, something like:

> C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Google SketchUp 8\Plugins

or

> C:\Program Files (x86)\SketchUp\SketchUp 2013\Plugins

Note that in SketchUp 2014, this has moved and (I think) there are also
per-user plugin folders.

If you're starting from a source zip, you'll have to overlay the appropriate
binary files into the `osgconv` folder.

Generating .rbz Files
---------------------
On a system with a `sh`-compatible shell (Mac or Linux, and possibly
Windows with MSYS or Cygwin) and the `7za` compressor executable on the
path, you can run the build scripts.

To build all, run:

    build/build-all.sh
    
To build just a single variant:

    build/build-one.sh VER PLATFORM

where `VER` is either `2014` or `2013`, and `PLATFORM` is either `mac`
or `win`.

Generating Installers
---------------------

### Windows
There's a `setup_X.iss` file for each version of SketchUp that defines a
few specific items then includes the shared `setup.iss` file. Using Inno Setup 5
(the Quick Start pack is suggested), compile those separate files: `setup.iss`
doesn't compile on its own.

### Mac
The PackageMaker files are in the main source directory, though they
need to be updated: see issue #15.

Licenses
--------
This plugin is free and open-source software.

The Ruby scripts serving as the SketchUp plugin may be distributed under
the following license:

> Copyright Iowa State University 2011,2013,2014

> Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0.

> (See accompanying file `osgconv/LICENSE_1_0.txt` or copy at

A local copy of `fileutils.rb` from the upstream Ruby project is bundled
with the installers and the 2013-version `.rbz` files, under its
license.

An actual in-use instance of this plugin makes use of the OpenSceneGraph
package and its dependencies, including but not limited to [COLLADA-DOM][4],
which have their own licenses.

Acknowledgement
---------------
If you find this useful, we would appreciate hearing from you. If you
use this for academic work, we would also appreciate a copy of the
publication and a citation: this helps make a case for our work. You may

Of course, this plugin would not be possible without the work of the
[OpenSceneGraph][2] and [COLLADA-DOM][4] teams. Thanks to them and the
others in the open-source ecosystem supporting them.
